## The Challenge

It was a difficult task, being given the challenge of making an icon for this netkit project. Such a small space, such a big project. Itâ€™s tough to know where to begin on an assignment like this. With the help of an associate, I had my first stroke of inspiration: a sponge.

## Artist's Opinion

The common, everyday object resembles simplicity and efficiency, two important attributes that inspired the creator, one Josh Hawking. Its flowing curves and incredible way of absorbing reflects the free flow of information and the way we students absorb it.

The purple N, standing for netkit, was colour coordinated to match the purple theme of this website. Purple, a colour famously linked to royalty, shows the importance of this project. Minimalism was my aim; to shrink something this big into one small image was challenging and fascinating. 

## The Eulogy

It was an absolute honour to be chosen for this job. As someone with little to no technical skills, it was one way I could be a part of this new and exciting technical movement. 

I hope you all download it and reap the benefits of the hard work from all those involved.
