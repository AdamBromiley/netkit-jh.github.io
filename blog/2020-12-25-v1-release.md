# Netkit V1 Release

## Compiling

- Improved build process for the filesystem (decreasing build times from 40 minutes to 10 minutes!) which will make updating and maintaining the filesystem easier.
- Improved build process for all modules
- Moved core tools into the build repo
- Updated UML tools to 64 bit (hoorah!)
- Use the UK debian repos to make downloading packages that little bit faster
- Added dockerfile to compile using Docker - thanks @b177y

## New in this release

- LFTP & at packages
- Added support for Kitty & Alacritty terminal emulators
- New install script which asks what terminal emulator you wish to use (and handles installation of it!)
- Added message about 'lclean' when labs don't start properly

## Bug fixes

- Removed mmapper_init failed error message
- Removed failed to load autofs4 module error message
- Set timeout of startup script service to 5 minutes
- `vstart --version` now lists the correct kernel/fs version

## Removed

- Netkit welcome message has been removed (was broken before due to a bad systemd service config)

## Coming in the future

- Removing net-tools dependancy from core tools
- Exploring the concept of different distros for filesystems
- Making it more stable :-)

Massive thanks to @okman12 and @b177y for assisting me in improving this version :-)

Most importantly, we're now at v1.0.0 of our new Netkit :) Our improvements to the building process (removal of rootstrap, combining of the two repos) and our upgrade to Debian Bullseye + Linux Kernel 5.9 justify a big version jump in my opinion. So welcome to v1.0.0, the best update we've had so far :-)
